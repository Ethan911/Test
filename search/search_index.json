When you add a link from one issue to another, links are added to both issues. Issue link types have a property that determines their direction. The direction determines how issues relate to one another. Issue link types can have one of the following link directions: Direction Description Directed This direction means that there is a subordinate relationship between the issues. For example, the Depend link type indicates that issue A is required for issue B. Inversely, issue B depends on issue A. In this case, the link type indicates that issue A must be resolved first. When you add the is required for link to issue A, a depends on link is automatically added to issue B. Undirected These link types merely demonstrate that the two issues are related to each other. Aggregation This direction means that the issues can be combined in some way. These links indicate that the issues duplicate each other or are parts of the same task. YouTrack provides the following default issue link types: Issue Link Type Direction Description Depend Directed Indicates that there is an issue that must be resolved before another issue. Duplicate Aggregation Indicates that the two issues describe the same condition and can be consolidated into a single issue. Relates Undirected Indicates that the two issues are related to one another, but are not dependant. Subtask Aggregation Indicates that an issue is a component of a larger effort. The effort that is spent on resolving the subtask contributes to the resolution of the parent task. An administrator can add other issue link types to YouTrack with different names, however, the behavior of these links is determined by their direction. All link types that use the same direction setting behave similarly. View Linked Issues You can see issue links in a few different locations. On the issue list, expand the issue detail to see the list of linked issues. Linked issues are grouped by issue link type.
